# BlackJack

I have decided to build a simple Black Jack game

## Finished code for......

* Displaying background, cards and buttons in the right positions

* Displaying cards, wtihout repeating the same card

* Positioning cards, and facing the dealers second card face down

* For the buttons, so the player can hit, and the dealers' card is shown face up 

* Converting the specific card values from 1-52 to 1-10

## Stil need to finish code for......

* Determining whether dealer or player busts, and if dealer should hit or stand

* Determining a winner

* Running a new continuosly untill player stops

## Things i want to implement......

* Showing statistics of the session played 

* Betting for the player

* Splitting and doubling

* Instant win if player has 21 and doesnt have 10 or Ace (Winner, Winner, Chicken Dinner!)

* Option to add several players

* Bonus games such as perfect pair

* Animation for clicking button

* Animation for dealing cards(dream on)
