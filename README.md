* Positioning cards, and facing the dealers second card face down

* For the buttons, so the player can hit, and the dealers' card is shown face up 

* Converting the specific card values from 1-52 to 1-10

* Determining whether dealer or player busts, and if dealer should hit or stand

* Determining a winner

* Using CSS when displaying the winner

* Showing the players points

* Betting for the player

* Starting a new game when the current game is finished
